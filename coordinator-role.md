title: Coordinator Role
---

A volunteer is selected by the organization to serve as the meeting coordinator for a six month term.  

This role requires 5-10 hours a month emailing people and setting up speakers.  At each meetup, the coordinator should ask the group if anyone is available to speak the following month.  There is a Slack channel dedicated to discussing 'meetup-speakers' and another dedicated to 'pdxruby-bizness' that the coordinator should join.  

The coordinator should reach out to folks who they think would have an interesting story - sometimes friends or colleagues and sometimes just cold calling (everyone is usually nice even if they say no).

Putting together a good talk generally takes 5-20 hours, depending on depth etc., so folks usually need to be notified a few weeks prior to speaking in order to prepare.

### Agenda

The agenda for the meetup and the speakers need to be confirmed the Friday before the event so that the Event Hosts can organize pizza and beverages.  


#### If you need to cancel and event

If a meeting needs to be cancelled.  

 - Post in the Slack Announcements channel
 - Post in the Twitter account
 - Cancel the event through Meetup
